# Machine_Learning_Image_Classification
In this assignment, we will build a convolutional neural network that can predict whether two shoes are from the
same pair or from two different pairs. This kind of application can have real-world applications: for example to
help people who are visually impaired to have more independence.
We will explore two convolutional architectures.
